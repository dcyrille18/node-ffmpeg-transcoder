# BREAKING CHANGE:  a commit that has the text "BREAKING CHANGE:" at the
# beginning of its optional body or footer section introduces a breaking
# API change (correlating with MAJOR in semantic versioning).
# A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.

# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
# change?

# A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to
# complete the following sentence :
# If applied, this commit will <your subject line here>

# Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
# bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
# generated by commands like git merge and git revert.
